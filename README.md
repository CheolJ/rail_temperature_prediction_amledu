## 1. Abstract
>
> `Rail temperature` is critical feature at train industry. Thesedays, where air temperature has increased becasue of abnormal climate, train system is suffered by rail temperature. At high rail temperature, the risk of buckling on rail increases and the train operates at slow speed to keep the trian from derailment resulted from buckling. Train industries have monitored rail temperature by directly measuring rail temperature to maintain the rail and train safety. However, it is difficult to measure temperature across the full section of the rail, because of cost or maintenance of measurement system. The train industries now focus on predicting rail temperature.  
> On this study, we developed `rail temperature prediction model` using machine learning with the data provided by the meteorlogical agency. We developed our model by 4 steps as shown below.  
>>
>>1. Data acquisition at measurement system(desigend by AML)
>>2. Data wrangling and analyzing features
>>3. Select machine learning algorithms and evaluate models
>>4. Select the model showing the best performance
>>5. Analyzing features for predictin rail temperature  
>>
> We evaluated our model's performance with r-square and mean absolute error. Our model showed high performance at the whole range of the rail temperature, especially at high rail temperature(over 40℃), compared to reported rail temperature prediction models. We also explains what features are important for rail temperature at different temperature ranges.

## 2. Outcome
>
> Two papers related to this study are currently being reviewed and one is being prepared for publication. We presented relevant research at 3 conferences(_2018 Asian Conference on Railway Engineering and Transportation, __2020 Spring Korean railway Conference, 2020 Asian Conference on Railway Engineering__(**postponed to Nov 2021**)_). We also won the `Excellent Paper Presentation Award from 2020 spring korean railway conference!`.
